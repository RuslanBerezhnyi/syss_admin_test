# Technical Decisions and Implementation Details

## 1. Infrastructure Design Choices

### Docker-based Infrastructure
- **Why**: Chose Docker for local development and testing to ensure consistency and easy setup
- **Benefit**: No need for full VMs, faster deployment, and consistent environments
- **Trade-off**: Some limitations in system-level configurations compared to VMs

### Terraform + Docker Provider
- **Why**: Used Terraform with Docker provider for declarative infrastructure
- **Benefit**: Version-controlled infrastructure, repeatable deployments
- **Trade-off**: Additional complexity compared to docker-compose

### Ansible Configuration
- **Why**: Used Ansible for configuration management over shell scripts
- **Benefit**: Idempotent configuration, role-based organization
- **Trade-off**: Learning curve for new team members

## 2. Technical Decisions

### PHP-FPM Configuration
- Used TCP socket instead of Unix socket for better container compatibility
- Configured proper FastCGI parameters for security
- Separated PHP-FPM and Nginx containers for better scalability

### Nginx Setup
- Implemented separate location blocks for different endpoints
- Added proper FastCGI configurations
- Included error and access logging

### CI/CD Implementation
- Used GitHub Actions for automation
- Implemented separate workflows for Terraform and Ansible
- Added artifact storage for Terraform plans

## 3. Security Considerations

- Limited container exposure (only necessary ports)
- Proper file permissions in shared volumes
- Environment-specific configurations
- No sensitive data in version control

## 4. Scalability & Maintenance

- Modular Ansible roles for easy expansion
- Terraform configurations split into logical files
- Documented requirements and dependencies
- Included testing scripts and procedures

## 5. Future Improvements

- Add container health checks
- Implement blue-green deployment capability
- Add monitoring and logging solutions
- Extend test coverage
